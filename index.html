We set the bar high: only clubs with strong and detailed Why-alignment will become a part of it. Trust is the currency that fuels longer than money ever could. <strong>We're not here to add women's teams onto an old system. We're here to rebuild the system â€” so it works for players, for clubs, and for fans.</strong></p>
